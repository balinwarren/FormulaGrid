# FormulaGrid
Formula Grid is a website much like the baseball hit immaculategrid.com but reinvented for the world of Formula 1
This has been a large indeavor for me as my first full stack webapp from start to finish. Challenges I have faced so far is learning how to build a properly responsive website
for both desktop and mobile, gathering all the data for the entire history of Formula 1 (there are pre existing databases with public apis but I wanted the learning opportunity of creating
my own database and and api), and managing the frontend and the backend(I have never built a backend before).
